I am Bi Xuanming, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong, with a strong academic foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and software engineering. My research focuses on intelligent systems that bridge human-computer interaction and real-world applications, including fall detection for elderly care, cross-domain facial expression recognition, and energy-efficient control systems. I have contributed to multiple published research projects and led the development of full-stack platforms involving large-scale data processing, mobile app development, and reinforcement learning. As a Research Assistant at HKUST (GZ), I was involved in a variety of interdisciplinary projects, such as a low-carbon campus cloud platform, a real-time underwater robot control interface, and a smart battery management app. I am proficient in Java, Python, C++, React, SQL, and Android, with practical experience in technologies like PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, and Modelica. My passion lies in applying AI-driven solutions to meaningful problems, supported by a strong track record in academic research, software development, and national-level mathematical modeling competitions.
