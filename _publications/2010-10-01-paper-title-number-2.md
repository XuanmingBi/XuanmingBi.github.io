excerpt: 'To support multi-source data stream generated from Internet of Things devices, edge computing emerges as a promising computing pattern with low latency and high bandwidth compared to cloud computing. To enhance the performance of edge computing within limited communication and computation resources, we study a cloud-edge-end computing architecture, where one cloud server and multiple computational access points can collaboratively process the compute-intensive data streams that come from multiple sources. Moreover, a multi-source environment is considered, in which the wireless channel and the characteristic of the data stream are time-varying. To adapt to the dynamic network environment, we first formulate the optimization problem as a markov decision process and then decompose it into a data stream offloading ratio assignment sub-problem and a resource allocation sub problem. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the action space, we further design a novel approach that combines the proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheme with convex optimization, where the PPO is used for the data stream offloading assignment, while the convex optimization is employed for the resource allocation. The simulated out comes in this work can help the development of the application of the multi-source data stream.'
